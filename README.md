My solutions to ProjectEuler problems


I have started coding solutions for problems in project euler.I've used Python 3.3 to solve all the problems.
The files present within this repo are a list of solutions that i've solved with the file name as the problem description.
Help me to make them efficient. Thanks and yeah I'll be updating this repo with the solutions when i resume the process of cracking 
the solutions..hopefully in my free time. This time I'm hoping to solve them in coming months like June etc. Hang on and please share the solution 
and advice me on how can i make it more efficient.
